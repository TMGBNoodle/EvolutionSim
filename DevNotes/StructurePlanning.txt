Overarching Game Manager:
Creates initial sets of entities.
Establishes parameters.
Dynamic Parameter Changes and Conditions.
Requires:
	A datatype that allows for creation of new parameters referenced by String and Id.
	These parameters are localized for each entity. Every entity has a value for every parameter provided by game manager.
	Can be updated dynamically. How to allow for variable conditions? Simple add sub call inbuilt in parameter, just code different params in?
	Can hardcode a few base level things that can be changed on runtime. Probably not, could be a lot of extra work for a relatively small bonus. May reevaluate later.
Genome can determine parameter? Maybe determines parameter change conditions too? Would be interesting to observe ways to represent each "Entity" outside of a literal creature
however breaks away from current goals for project so shelving that. May revist.

Actual function of genome:
Determines Neural net connections, credit to davidrandallmiller (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3tRFayqVtk) for the idea. May recreate his exact neural net model 
will credit better if I do. More research on NN evolution. Look into transformer networks? Reactive decision trees? Too much right now. Will create game manager.
